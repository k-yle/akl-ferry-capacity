          This app shows you which ferry is currently operating each route in
          Auckland, and how many passengers and bikes it can take.
          <br />
          <br />
          Itâ€™s quite common that the smaller ferries leave people behind because
          of their limited capacity. This app helps you judge whether to take
          the ferry or not.
